abstract: A mutation profile can be determined for an individual's DNA sequence or sequence segment that provides information about the evolutionary history of the DNA. This mutation profile can then be used with a machine learning classifier trained on other people's mutation profiles to determine probabilities that the individual has certain phenotypes. An example is cancer, where the probabilities of different types of cancer can be provided in a disease risk propensity.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: A patent for mutation profiles and their ability to predict disease propensity.
